# pycronometer

Python client implementation for downloading account data from https://cronometer.com/. Inspired by [gocronometer](https://github.com/jrmycanady/gocronometer).

# How to use this? 

Currently there are no supported APIs to extract data directly, this is a hack using APIs underlying Cronometer application. Code relies on passing in some variables that appear to change over time - need to explain what these are and where to get these.
